# VeriJSON

An Objective-C library for verifying JSON against a pattern-based schema.

VeriJSON is designed to verify that the JSON you've received from a web service has the structure you expect before you try to extract information from it.

## Patterns

Michael Sprindzuikate suggested the pattern approach for VeriJSON.

A pattern describes the expected content of a JSON document. Patterns are themselves valid JSON, and mirror the structure of a matching JSON document by including property names, arrays and objects. Instead of values, a pattern specifies the required type of values.

Allowed types are "number", "string" and "bool". Arrays and objects are represented structurally.

A sample pattern:

    {
        "id": "number",
        "name": "string",
        "price": "number",
        "discounted": "bool",
        "manufacturer": {
            "name": "string"
        },
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "string",
                "value": "string",
                "tags": [ "string" ]
            }
        ]
    }

A JSON document that successfully matches the pattern:

    {
        "id": 1,
        "price": 12.50,
        "name": "A green door",
        "manufacturer": {
            "name": "ACME"
        },
        "discounted": true,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "blah",
                "value": "whatever",
                "tags": [ "great" ]
            },
            {
                "name": "foo",
                "value": "bar",
                "tags": [ ]
            }
        ]
    }

By default, all properties in the pattern are mandatory. JSON documents omitting the properties are not considered to match. However, properties appearing in the JSON document that are not part of the pattern are ignored and considered to match.

## Optional properties

If a property within an object is optional, suffix its name in the pattern with a question mark '?'.

For example:

	{
        "id": "number",
        "name": "string",
        "discounted?": "bool"
    }

All of the following JSON documents successfully match this pattern:

	{
        "id": 4,
        "name": "A green door",
        "discounted": true
    }

	{
        "id": 4,
        "name": "A green door"
    }

	{
        "id": 4,
        "name": "A green door",
        "discounted": null
    }

Note that an optional property may also have a "null" value. This is not true of non-optional properties.

## Regular expressions

The string type may also include an optional regular expression to which a value must conform.

	{
	    "date": "string:\\d{8}"
	}

Matches:

	{
	    "date": "20130101"
	}

Does not match:
	
	{
	    "date": "130101"
	}

## URL types

Links are often expressed in JSON. To verify URLs, use the "url" type.

    {
        "self": "url"
    }

Any non-empty (and non-whitespace) string that can be converted to an NSURL object is considered a match.

Note that this permits URLs other than HTTP URLs, such as FTP URLs, and also relative URLs.

To limit matches to absolute HTTP and HTTPS URLs, append the "http" modifier to the "url" type.

    {
        "self": "url:http"
    }

## Usage

VeriJSON expects the JSON object/array and pattern to be represented as Objective-C objects (as opposed to strings).

To do this, use the built-in NSJSONSerialization class to convert the raw data from a request or string into a JSON object. Do the same for your pattern JSON (which would typically be stored in your app bundle but may also be requested over a network).

	// Deserialise the JSON data from a request into an NSDictionary or NSArray.
    NSData *jsonData = request.data;
    id json = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:jsonData options:0 error:NULL];
    
	// Deserialise the pattern data from your app bundle into an NSDictionary or NSArray.
    NSString *patternPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Pattern" ofType:@"json"];
    NSData *patternData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:patternPath];
    id pattern = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:patternData options:0 error:NULL];

Then simply pass the Objective-C JSON object and pattern object into VeriJSON.

	// Verify the JSON against the pattern.
	BOOL valid = [[VeriJSON new] verifyJSON:json pattern:pattern];

## Installing

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the easiest way to use VeriJSON. Note that you may need to specify the iOS version you're targeting.

	platform :ios, '5.1'
	pod 'VeriJSON'
	
If you'd rather not use CocoaPods, just copy the directory VeriJSON/VeriJSON into your project.

Import VeriJSON in any places you'd like to use it:

	#import "VeriJSON.h"

## Related work

[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) is another JSON based format for describing JSON data. It is more explicit in the way it models documents, and is able to describe more complicated structures. There are also a number of existing implementations.

By comparison, VeriJSON trades expressiveness for clarity.
